  <h1>2017 April's Fool</h1>
  <p>
    For this year April 1st, I coded a fake Algolia API client in CSS.
  </p>
  <p>
    It is not a real API client, but a carefully crafted CSS file that
    gives the illusion of search. There is no call to the API at all, everything is handled through CSS selectors (using and abusing
    <code>input[value='xxx']</code> selectors).
  </p>
  <p>
    I took the list of all Algolia employees (as displayed on the website), wrote a simple Ruby parser to
    generate all the <code>n-grams</code>, and generated a CSS file from that.
  </p>
  <p>
    I've tried to replicate as many features from the engine as I could, but was quickly limited by the size of the generated CSS file
    (generating all potential typos quickly exploded the filesize).
  </p>
  <p>
    You'll find below several versions with an increasing number of features but also increased file size. Let me know which one is the sweet spot for you.

  <ul>
    <li><a href="./basic.html">Simple search</a> (800Kb)</li> 
    <li><a href="./roles.html">Simple search + search in job title</a> (2.2Mb)</li> 
    <li><a href="./facets.html">Simple search + facetting</a> (2.3Mb)</li> 
    <li><a href="./typos.html">Simple search + 1-letter typos</a> (2.2Mb)</li> 
    <li><a href="./facets-roles.html">Simple search + search in job title + facetting</a> (4.4Mb)</li> 
    <li><a href="./roles-typos.html">Simple search + search in job title + typos</a> (5.0Mb)</li> 
    <li><a href="./facets-typos.html">Simple search + facetting + typos</a> (5.7Mb)</li> 
    <li><a href="./full.html">Simple search + search in job titles + facetting + typos</a> (11Mb ðŸ˜­)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Each new feature add more weight to the CSS file, up to a point where you feel your browser is actually having trouble parsing them all.
