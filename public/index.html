  <h1>2017 April's Fool</h1>
  <p>
    For this year April 1st, I coded a fake Algolia API client in CSS.
  </p>
  <p>
    <img src="./screencast.gif" />
  </p>
  <p>
    It is not a real API client, but a carefully crafted CSS file that
    gives the illusion of search. There is no call to the API at all, everything is handled through CSS selectors (using and abusing
    <code>input[value='xxx']</code> selectors).
  </p>
  <p>
    I took the list of all Algolia employees (as displayed on the website), wrote a simple Ruby parser to
    generate all the <code>n-grams</code>, and generated a CSS file from that.
  </p>
  <p>
    I've tried to replicate as many features from the engine as I could, but was quickly limited by the size of the generated CSS file
    (generating all potential typos quickly exploded the filesize).
  </p>
  <p>
    You'll find below several versions with an increasing number of features but also increased file size. Let me know which one is the sweet spot for you.
  </p>
  <p>
    Keep in mind that this is not to be used in production. It's an April's fool, but is also a nice playground for educational content and
    explain how search works.

  <h2>#1: <a href="./basic.html">Basic search</a> (CSS Filesize: 800Kb)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Fun fact on hover of results</li>
    <li>Highlight</li>
    <li>Case insensitive search</li>
    <li>Search in first name or last name (hits in first name returned first)</li>
    <li>Ranking by arrival date</li>
    <li>Handles accented characters (try Clement or Clément)</li>
    <li>Handles composed words (try Marie or Laure)</li>
    <li>Handles synonyms (try rcs, pizza or flexbox)</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>#2: <a href="./facets.html">Facetting</a> (CSS Filesize: 2Mb)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Same features as #1</li>
    <li>List of teams, along with count</li>
    <li>Facet count updated as-you-type</li>
    <li>Facets ordered by count</li>
    <li>One facet can be selected and it will update the results</li>
    <li>Can unselect a facet</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>#3: <a href="./typos.html">Typo-tolerance</a> (CSS Filesize: 2Mb)</h2>

    <li>Still correctly highlight the typos</li>
    <li>⚠ UI is slightly slower</li>
  </ul>

  <ul>
    <li>Same features as #1, #2 and #3</li>
    <li>⚠ UI is sluggish</li>
  </ul>
