  <h1>2017 April's Fool</h1>
  <p>
    For this year April 1st, I coded a fake Algolia API client in CSS.
  </p>
  <p>
    It is not a real API client, but a carefully crafted CSS file that
    gives the illusion of search. There is no call to the API at all, everything is handled through CSS selectors (using and abusing
    <code>input[value='xxx']</code> selectors).
  </p>
  <p>
    I took the list of all Algolia employees (as displayed on the website), wrote a simple Ruby parser to
    generate all the <code>n-grams</code>, and generated a CSS file from that.

  <ul>
    <li>As-you-type experience</li>
    <li>No call to the API, no JavaScript dependencies</li>
    <li>Works offline™</li>
    <li>Dynamic faceting, with counts</li>
    <li>Search in name and job title</li>
    <li>Highlighting</li>
    <li>Synonyms (try rcs, pizza or flexbox)</li>
    <li>Typo-tolerance (try niolas or jnas)</li>
    <li>Handles accented characters (try clément or clement)</li>
    <li>Handles composed words (try Marie or Laure)</li>
    <li>Ranking formula: a match in the name is returned before a match in the job title</li>
    <li>Custom ranking: in case of ties, results are sorted by arrival date</li>

  </ul>
